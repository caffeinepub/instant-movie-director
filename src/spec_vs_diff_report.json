A Publish/Deploy help dialog and a DEPLOYMENT.md file were added, but the diff excerpts are truncated and only clearly show prerequisites + local deploy steps; mainnet deploy steps, expected artifacts/IDs, and troubleshooting are not evidenced. Some unrelated changes (backend authorization/state changes and a new footer credit/link) appear outside the BuildRequest scope.",

      "requirement": "Help view includes clear step-by-step instructions covering both local development deployment and IC mainnet deployment, including exact commands and expected artifacts/IDs, readable without external links.",
      "reason": "The added PublishHelpDialog content in the diff clearly shows prerequisites and local deployment steps, but the excerpt is truncated before any mainnet deployment steps and before the “what artifacts/IDs to expect” section can be confirmed.",

      "reason": "DEPLOYMENT.md is added and references “Instant Movie Director” and prerequisites, but the diff is truncated early (ending around the start of local deploy step 1). Build steps, mainnet steps, and troubleshooting are not visible in the provided excerpt, so completion cannot be verified from the diff summary.",
