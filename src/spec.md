# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Prepare the app for public publishing by finalizing “Instant Movie Director” branding and adding clear deployment guidance for the Internet Computer.

**Planned changes:**
- Update visible branding text to consistently use “Instant Movie Director” (e.g., header brand text and browser tab/document title).
- Add an in-app “Publish” / “Deployment” help view accessible from an obvious UI entry point, with step-by-step local and mainnet Internet Computer deployment commands and expected outputs (canister IDs/artifacts).
- Add or update repository deployment documentation (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT.md`) covering prerequisites, local deploy steps, mainnet deploy steps, and basic troubleshooting, referencing “Instant Movie Director”.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays the correct “Instant Movie Director” name in the UI and browser tab, and users can open an in-app Publish/Deployment guide (plus repo docs) to follow clear instructions to deploy locally or to IC mainnet.
